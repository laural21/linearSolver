# linearSolver


This parallel program was written as an assignment for the course CSCI-UA 0480-003 - Parallel Computing at NYU.

It uses the Message Passing Interface MPI to find unknowns in a set of linear equations with an increasing accuracy, provided some original values for the unknowns and the desired absolute relative error.
Parts of this code were provided by Professor Mohamed Zahran.
